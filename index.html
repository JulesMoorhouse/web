    <h3>Welcome</h3>

    <p>
        Welcome to my site, I'm called Jules to everyone who knows me, although my real name is Julian Moorhouse.
    </p>

    <p>
        What is this site about?
        The aim of my site is to allow me to show off some of my projects and allow me to add blog posts about development topics that interest me. Over the years I have developed several projects. More recently I've opened sourced some of these projects on <a href="https://github.com/JulesMoorhouse">GitHub</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Please see my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/">Projects</a> page for all apps in the iOS app store and some older projects.
    <p>
        From the projects page you will also see links to my project mini-sites.
    </p>

    <p>
        As mentioned, for my older projects, you can also checkout my <a href="{{ site.github }}">Github</a> repositories, that I have recently made open source.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you'd like to drop me a line or need support for one of my iOS apps, please use the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contactme/">contact</a> page.

        Recently (2022 / 2021), to drive home my SwiftUI development knowledge, I wrote a portfolio app, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pmb">Pain Meds Buddy</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Admittedly, this was initially based on the Hacking with Swift Plus course, however it far outgrew the course syllabus. In fact I learn a great deal from my mistakes.

        From the end of 2020 til May 2021, I studied the <a href="https://github.com/JulesMoorhouse/100DaysOfSwiftUI">100 of days of SwiftUI</a> course. Having done the first course, I was keen to start. I was also able to work on the course during personal development day each week in my last role.

        In the summer of 2019 I completed the <a href="https://github.com/JulesMoorhouse/100DaysOfSwift">100 of days of Swift</a> training sessions. I really enjoyed the course, especially building SpriteKit games. This is a tweet that I tweeted at the time, although it's quite large, it's quite fun.

    <h4>Speaking Times Tables</h4>
    <div style="clear: left;"></div>

     <div style="float: right; width: 120px; padding-left: 20px;">
        <img title="The logo for Speaking Times Tables" height="100" width="100" src="/static/img-300/icon-speaking-times-tables.png">
    </div>

    <p>	
        With <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/stt">Speaking Times Tables</a> which I wrote in 2015, it has become one of my main apps, which I've actively continued to develop and upgrade. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Initially I wrote the app for the original iPad, later I made the app universal and added iCloud support to enable use in classrooms. You can read more about the design process <a href="stt/features/how-we-designed-the-app">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact this was version two of the app, version one I developed, which was my first iPhone app  which sadly is no longer in the app store, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ myfirstapp_url }}">here the product page</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        At the time I spent a couple of years full time developing apps, while I was a stay home dad, it was a wonderful time.
    </p>
        <p>
        Since adding iCloud sync to, I've extracted the functionality into a framework and started incorporating into new apps. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I then brought iCloud sync to Sad Face Chart (see below) and I started work on refactoring this code into a framework, which was released in 2019.
    </p>

    <h4>Balance Guide</h4>

    <div style="float: left; width: 120px;">
        <img title="The logo for Balance Guide" height="100" width="100" src="/static/img-300/icon-balance-guide.png">
    </div>

    <p>
        I developed my second iPhone app <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bg">Balance Guide</a> in 2010. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Why did I develop it? Well I wanted some way to manage my finances on my iPhone and I thought it would be cool to write an app myself. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I was hooked. Since then, it's been my favourite app, I just can't drag myself away. I've been adding new features and updating it ever since, why ? Because I use it myself. 
    </p>
    <p>	
        I have to say that I've had to hold myself back from adding certain features and consider my user base, it's far too easy to add everything everyone requests and make design mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since then and into 2020 I've had to go back to update my apps for iOS13 and dark mode.
    </p>

    <div style="clear: left;"></div>
    <h4>Sad Face Chart</h4>
    <div style="float: right; width: 120px; padding-left: 20px;">
        <img title="The logo for Happy / Sad Face Chart" height="100" width="100" src="/static/img-300/icon-sad-face-chart.png">
    </div>
    <p>			
        In 2011 I wrote <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/sadfacechart">Sad Face Chart</a>, again this was an app primarily written for personal use.
    </p>
    <p>			
        Although the icon was different to that shown here back then.
    </p>

    <h4>Revenue Calc</h4>
    <div style="float: left; width: 120px;">
        <img title="The icon for Revenue Calc" height="100" width="100" src="/static/img-300/icon-revenue-calc.png">
    </div>
    <p>
        I'm not going to say much about  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/revenuecalc">Revenue Calc</a> other than it initially took a short time to develop, it's quite a simple app, I wanted to complete something quickly, after developing Balance Guide.
