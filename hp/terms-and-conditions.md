<h4>Terms &amp; Conditions</h4>

<p>Last updated: October 16, 2024</p>

<p>
By downloading or using the app, these terms will
automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re
not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app,
or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
to extract the source code of the app, and you also
shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or
make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade
marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
property rights related to it, still belong to
Mindwarp Consultancy Ltd..
</p>

<p>
Mindwarp Consultancy Ltd. is committed to ensuring that the app
is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge
for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will
never charge you for the app or its services without making
it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
</p>

<p>
The Hike Planner app stores and processes personal data
that you have provided to us, in order to provide
our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
process of removing software restrictions and limitations
imposed by the official operating system of your device. It
could make your phone vulnerable to
malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
security features and it could mean that the
Hike Planner app won’t work properly or at all.
</p>

<p>
You should be aware that there are certain things that
Mindwarp Consultancy Ltd. will not take responsibility for.
Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an
active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
provided by your mobile network provider, but
Mindwarp Consultancy Ltd. cannot take responsibility for the
app not working at full functionality if you don’t have
access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
allowance left.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
for the duration of the connection while accessing the app,
or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re
accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume
that you have received permission from the bill payer for
using the app.
</p>

<p>
Along the same lines, Mindwarp Consultancy Ltd. cannot always
take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You
need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it
runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
Service, Mindwarp Consultancy Ltd. cannot accept
responsibility.
</p>

<p>
With respect to Mindwarp Consultancy Ltd.’s responsibility for
your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to
ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
we can make it available to you.
Mindwarp Consultancy Ltd. accepts no liability for any loss,
direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
wholly on this functionality of the app.
</p>

<p>
At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
currently available on iOS – the requirements for
system (and for any additional systems we
decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
using the app. Mindwarp Consultancy Ltd. does not promise that
it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
and/or works with the iOS version that you have
installed on your device. However, you promise to always
accept updates to the application when offered to you, We
may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate
use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
(a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
delete it from your device.
